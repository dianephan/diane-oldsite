            <!-- <p>I took 2 years of drama and theatre class in high school because I was 
            interested in acting as different characters. The two years taught me that 
            acting is more than just reading off a script, it is <i>becoming</i> the character. 
            <br>Other than learning how to act and improvise, I had experience in writing plays,
            designing sets, and overall, working as a team to make a play come to life. </br>
            <br>I do not participate in theatre anymore, but I enjoy working on closet cosplays. 
            My work is not professional, but it is fun to put together pieces of clothing
            that I find in my closet so that I can look like my favorite characters. Sometimes I like to
            do photoshoots with my photographer friends to show off my cosplay and play the character.</br>
