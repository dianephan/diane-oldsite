            <h3>
                I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am studying Statistical Science to gain quantitative skills. I would like to spend more time programming and making art through code because I believe that coding can be an outlet for creativity. </h3>
                
            <h3>
                <br><br>This was my first time using Javascript to make art, and I would love to add to this portfolio in the future. I hope that my work can inspire people to pick up programming as a profession or a hobby.
