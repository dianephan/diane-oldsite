    <p>I wanted to compare the amount of time that people spend on their electronic devices with the amount of time they spend exercising per week. Male and female participants over the age of 18 participated in this research. 
    <br>
    As you can see, I divided the data into gender and age groups. For gender, it is obvious that I distinguished between male and female participants by assigning a color to them. Underneath their circle is their age. The radius of the circle is dependent on how much time they spend doing the activity.
