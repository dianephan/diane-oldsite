    <p>This is my first time using Javascript to create a picture for an hypothetical music album. I wanted to make some sort of abstract art and play with pastel colors, lines, and rectangles. It was difficult to plot down the points, but I realized that I could import the picture onto MSPaint to read the coordinates off there. </p>
