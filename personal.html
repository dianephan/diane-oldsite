            <h1>I like a lot of things, perhaps, too many things.</h1>
            <h2>I am a huge Disney fan, and I'd be delighted to help you plan your trip.</h2>
            <p>I hope to make an app that will help people plan their Disneyland vacations with ease,
            allowing parents to work with their children to make the trip as memorable as it can be.</p>
            
            <h2>I enjoy listening to different genres of music.</h2>
            <br>My favorite music producers are Porter Robinson and Madeon.</br>
            <p>I discovered them over the summer of 2015. Up until then, I had never had any artist
            change my life the way these two did. Their work is incredibly inspiring, and I hope to create
            something as magnificent as they have. I admire the impact they have had on their fans,
            including myself. Ask me more about them and my experiences at their concerts. My eyes are
            guaranteed to widen as I tell you about them.</p>
            
            <br>I also enjoy musicals.</br>
            <!-- <p>I am still waiting for the day I get to experience a live musical. When "Les Miserables"
            released their soundtrack, I listened to it for three months straight. I am also a fan of
            the Wicked soundtrack. I know all the lyrics to the first two "High School Musical" movies, 
            and my favorite song from "Rent" is "Seasons of Love".</p> -->
