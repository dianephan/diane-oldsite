            <p>I discovered them over the summer of 2015. Up until then, I had never had any artist
            change my life the way these two did. Their work is incredibly inspiring, and I hope to create
            something as magnificent as they have. I admire the impact they have had on their fans,
            including myself. Ask me more about them and my experiences at their concerts. My eyes are
            guaranteed to widen as I tell you about them.</p>
            
            <br>I also enjoy musicals.</br>
            I am still waiting for the day I get to experience a live musical. When "Les Miserables"
            released their soundtrack, I listened to it for three months straight. I am also a fan of
            the Wicked soundtrack. I know all the lyrics to the first two "High School Musical" movies, 
            and my favorite song from "Rent" is "Seasons of Love".</p> -->
